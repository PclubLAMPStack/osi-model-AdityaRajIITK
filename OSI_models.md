## OSI model layers

The OSI model consists of seven layers, each of which is responsible for a specific aspect of network communication. These layers are:

1.**Physical layer**: The physical layer is responsible for the transmission of raw bits over a communication channel, including the physical characteristics of the transmission medium. Examples of protocols associated with this layer include Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth.

2.**Data link layer**: The data link layer is responsible for the reliable transmission of data frames over a communication channel, including error detection and correction. Examples of protocols associated with this layer include the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP), High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC), and Ethernet.

3.**Network layer**: The network layer handles the routing of data packets between different networks, including addressing and routing protocols. Examples of protocols associated with this layer include the Internet Protocol (IP), Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), and Routing Information Protocol (RIP).

4.**Transport layer**: The transport layer provides end-to-end data delivery and ensures the reliability and integrity of data transmission between applications. Examples of protocols associated with this layer include Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), User Datagram Protocol (UDP), and Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP).

5.**Session layer**: The session layer establishes, manages, and terminates communication sessions between applications. Examples of protocols associated with this layer include Remote Procedure Call (RPC), Structured Query Language (SQL), and Network File System (NFS).

6.**Presentation layer**: The presentation layer is responsible for the formatting and presentation of data, including encryption and decryption. Examples of protocols associated with this layer include Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), Transport Layer Security (TLS), and JPEG.

7.**Application layer**: The application layer provides a user interface for accessing network services and applications. Examples of protocols associated with this layer include Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), and File Transfer Protocol (FTP).
